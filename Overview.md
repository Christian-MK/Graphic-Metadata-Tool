# Graphic Metadata Tool
Designed to reveal embedded EXIF data and enable file revision
<br>

## Objective
The purpose of this program is to reveal and allow users to extract metadata from image files. 
While access to this information on its own is of value, this program allows users to rename their graphic objects 
by appending metadata element values to the file name. This allows for the creation of efficient naming conventions
and causes file names to be more uniform and easier to access for end users. Individuals
who work with metadata and large numbers of files/folders stand to benefit from such a
program, particularly individuals who work within the areas of digital asset management,
digital collections management, or digital libraries/archives.

## Scope
The program script utilizes the following: user input and file retrieval;
iterative loops; lists and dictionaries; and more. Individuals using the program 
have the ability to call for a folder, rename files, and add, remove, or alter EXIF data in order to 
suit their needs.

The final outputs are folders/files that follow a naming convention selected by the user that are
easily readable and sorted for end users. An additional output is the creation of a .txt file
which will document: the local device used; the extracted metadata; all choices and changes regarding 
that metadata and their object; along with the date and time the file was accessed.
This final output is designed primarily fwith institutions in mins so as to increase transparency 
around how stewards of graphic objects interact with and manipulate these objects through the course of their work
over time.
