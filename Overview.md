# PythonGroupProject
A tool for revealing embedded EXIF data and file revision

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to create a program to extract metadata from image files
and rename each file within a folder according to a particular naming convention,
rendering these files more uniform and easier to sort through for end users. Individuals
who work with metadata and large numbers of files/folders would benefit from such a
program, particularly individuals who work within the areas of digital asset management,
digital collections management, or digital libraries/archives.

## Scope
The program would easily utilize the following from class: user input and file retrieving;
definite loops; lists; and databases, among others. Individuals using the program would
have the ability to call for a folder, rename files, and add, remove, or alter EXIF data as
desired.

The final output would be folders/files that follow a uniform naming convention that are
easily readable and sorted for end users. There would be an additional file output in
which all metadata associated with these folders/files will be held within a table.
The program will require the use of an outside application that will extract the metadata
from each image fileâ€™s EXIF data - this will be cited within the finalized program
